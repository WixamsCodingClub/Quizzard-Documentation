# Quizzard Documentation

Welcome documentation for the Quizzard app being built across multiple repositories within the Wixams Coding Club.

Quizzard is a quiz app being built on different platforms to help people in the club learn how to program. Currently apps are being built on the following platforms, the repositories will be added here in due course:

* Android
* iOS
* Flutter

The Quizzard app is very simple, it's a quiz game where the user is asked a series of multi-choice questions and after completing the game they are shown their score. 

When the app launches the user is shown a Welcome screen which includes a button to start the quiz. The questions are obtained from a public API available on the internet and displayed in turn to the user on the Question screen. Once all the questions have been answered the userâ€™s score is displayed on the Results screen. From there the user can choose to start a new quiz.
